# Password Generator

## Task

I've been given access to sensitive data by my employer. In order to keep it secure, I've created a random password generator that meets certain criteria to create a strong password that provides greater security.  

## The Application

For the application I've created a simple webpage with a single generate password button. Once the button is clicked a series of prompts will follow that asks the user for their desired criteria. They are as follows:

* Length of the password (8-128)

* Include uppercase letters

* Include lowercase letters

* Include numbers

* Include special characters  

<br> 

There are validation checks to ensure a valid number between 8 and 128 and that the user confirms at least one character type.
When user confirms all criteria, a random password will be generated and will show up in the box.  
<br>
<br>
I used very simple HTML and CSS files with all the functionality of the webpage coming from the JavaScript file.

## Below I've included a link to the finished application along with a screenshot of the page
